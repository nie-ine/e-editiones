There are two series of ontologies: more generic and project ontologies.

The [generic ontologies](#generic-ontologies) comprise the core concepts for scholarly editions, as well as the bulk of entities modeled in agreement with the edition projects. They grouped into: 
- [General Domain Ontologies](#general-domain)
- [General Humanities Ontologies](#general-humanities)
- [Specific Humanities Ontologies](#specific-humanities)
- [External Terminology & Code Systems Ontology](#external-ontologies)

The [project ontologies](#project-ontologies) contain entities linked to the specific subjects of edition projects, but they are still usable outside the respective projects.
