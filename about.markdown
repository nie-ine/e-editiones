This website conains the knowledge, experience and products as outcome of the [NIE-INE](http://www.nie-ine.ch)-project, which runs at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, Zürich, and Geneva from Oct. 2016 until the end of 2020.

It developes the infrastructure inseri to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles. It provides the projects with the necessary apps and visualizations, and ensures long-term storage of the data by transferring those to another framework, the [Data and Service Center for humanities (DaSCH)](https://dasch.swiss/).

The essence of the infrastructure is that data, e.g. in XML or SQL, are converted to a different i.e. machine-interpretable format by using the W3C's [Semantic Web technology (SWT)](http://e-editiones.ch/semantic-web-technology) standards and by making the semantics of the data explicit.   
To enable data expression in this new format, a series of [ontologies](http://e-editiones.ch/ontology-library) are modeled with great care, based on those standards.  

Having semantic interoperability is only the beginning of the journey and part of the ROI (return on investment).
The crux of SWT is using the formal OWL-ontologies and the RDF-data expressed by them to infer new data from existing data bringing ultimately new domain knowledge. In other words, concretely using the built-in logic of the standard languages with [N3-rule-based machine reasoning](http://e-editiones.ch/n3-rule-based-machine-reasoning) represents the other part of the ROI, ánd the fun.  

We adopted a [two-step formalization](http://e-editiones.ch/two-step-formalization) methodology to implement the SWT end-to-end.
